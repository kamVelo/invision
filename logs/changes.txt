Changes:
- the main change in this iteration of invision is the implementation of a changes log in the first place, more on thsi below.
- secondly this iteration will have the ib.py trading script runnign in a thread so the application can move on.


expansion:
the reason I'm implementing a changes log is because I realise that I'm getting ever closer to my final goal and I'd like to somewhat
professionalise my project and a changes log seemed like the perfect way to do this whilst also making it easier to understand why
I've created a new iteration.
